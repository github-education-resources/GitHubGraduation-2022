# Who can apply 📝

We invite any student who has graduated, or plans to graduate, in 2022 to apply to the yearbook. This includes bootcamps, code camps, high school graduates, Master's graduates, Ph. D. Graduates, etc.

The eligibility criteria are -

1. You have been verified as a student with the GitHub Student Developer Pack. Not yet a part of the Pack? [Apply here](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/student_application?utm_source=2022-06-11-GitHubGraduation).
2. You have not participated in a past GitHub Graduation event.
3. You identify as a graduate in the year 2022.

# How to join the Class of 2022
Here are two steps to join graduation and receive your custom trading card and stickers in the mail. 

1. [Fill out the **shipping form**](https://airtable.com/shrVMo8ItH4wjsO9f)
   ⚠️ the form needs to be done before creating your Pull Request (PR) and does not guarantee participation in the event. Your PR must successfully merge into the repository and only the first 7,500 merged PRs will receive cards in the mail.
2. **Submit a pull request** with your profile information to join the Yearbook and be highlighted in the graduation event.

## 1. Fill out the shipping form.

Information submitted to [the swag shipment form](https://airtable.com/shrVMo8ItH4wjsO9f) is only used to ship trading cards for graduation. Submitting the form does not guarantee you will receive anything in the mail. Only the first 7,500 graduates to merge their Pull Request to the GitHub Yearbook will receive a shipment.

## 2. Add yourself to Yearbook 🏫
Replace `<YOUR-USERNAME>` with your GitHub username in this guide. Please note that the `<YOUR-USERNAME>` here is **Case Sensitive**. For Example, if your username is `MonaTheOctocat`, using anything other than it like `monatheoctocat` or `monaTheoctocat` will throw an error while submitting the Pull Request, make sure you're using the exact same case as your username in both the folder name and file name.

### First, create the folder \_data/YOUR-USERNAME/

Fork this repository, create a new folder inside the `_data` folder, and name it with your username. It should look something like this `_data/<YOUR-USERNAME>/`. Ex.

```
_data/MonaTheOctocat/
```

### Second, add your profile information

Create a markdown file in your folder following the convention `<YOUR-USERNAME>.md`. Ex.

```
_data/MonaTheOctocat/MonaTheOctocat.md
```

Copy the next template into your file, delete the boilerplate data and fill the information with yours.

```
---
name: FULLNAME-OR-NICKNAME # No longer than 28 characters
institution: INSTITUTION-NAME 🚩 # no longer than 58 characters
quote: YOUR-SENIOR-QUOTE # no longer than 100 characters, avoid using quotes(") to guarantee the format remains the same.
github_user: YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME
---
```

_Do not use special characters in the template above._

### Third, submit your Pull Request
Go through the checklist on the pull request template to guarantee your submission is valid. The GitHub Education team will review your application, approve and merge your submission if everything is correct. Otherwise, you will get notified of the changes requested in the pull request comment section.
